# Worker build network sources

HomeRail builds exactly one canonical Worker image from
`homerail_worker/Dockerfile`. By default the build uses the Debian
repositories shipped with the base image and npm's default registry; no
package-source build arguments are added. Operators whose networks cannot
reach those public endpoints can opt in to validated public mirrors through
three environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `HOMERAIL_WORKER_BUILD_APT_MIRROR` | Replaces the Debian main repository URL in non-security deb822 stanzas. |
| `HOMERAIL_WORKER_BUILD_APT_SECURITY_MIRROR` | Replaces the Debian security repository URL in security deb822 stanzas. |
| `HOMERAIL_WORKER_BUILD_NPM_REGISTRY` | Maps to the Docker `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY` build argument observed by every npm operation during the image build. It is build-only and is never persisted as a runtime environment variable. |

The two APT overrides are independent: each one rewrites only its matching
deb822 stanzas, and either can be used alone.

## Entry points

Every supported Worker image build entry point consumes the same contract
with the same environment names, validation, and argument semantics:

- the Manager Worker image build (`DagEnvironmentController.runBuild`),
  resolved by `homerail_manager/src/server/worker-build-network.ts`;
- production deployment, `scripts/deploy-production.sh`;
- the live acceptance runner, `scripts/run-dag-patterns-live-runner.sh`
  (also used by the PR Review and Three-Worker Showcase wrappers).

The operator scripts share `scripts/lib/worker-build-network.sh`, which
validates the environment and assembles a Docker argv array without ever
evaluating input.

## Validation contract

- Unset or whitespace-only values leave the corresponding source unchanged.
- Valid values use `http:` or `https:`, have a hostname, and contain no
  username, password, query, fragment, control characters, or raw
  whitespace.
- Trailing slashes, scheme case, and host case are normalized consistently,
  so semantically identical URLs produce identical build arguments.
- Invalid values are rejected before Docker starts. The error names the
  configuration key but never its value.

## Proxy forwarding

Recognized uppercase and lowercase `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and
`NO_PROXY` variables are forwarded to Docker as value-less
`--build-arg NAME` entries only when non-empty. HomeRail never declares,
expands, copies, inspects, persists, or logs their values; the existing
Docker client and BuildKit proxy configuration remains authoritative. When
no process proxy variable is forwarded, the Manager reports the proxy mode
as `docker-managed`, which does not claim that no proxy exists in Docker
state.

## Redacted status

Manager build status exposes only a redacted `worker_image.build_network`
summary with modes, never URLs:

- `apt_main`: `default` or `custom`
- `apt_security`: `default` or `custom`
- `npm`: `default` or `custom`
- `proxy`: `environment` or `docker-managed`

No source or proxy URL appears in status, task artifacts, or HomeRail-authored
build log messages.

## Security boundaries

- Source values are deliberately public build metadata and may be visible in
  image build metadata. Credential-bearing values are rejected: no username
  or password, no query or fragment tokens, and no private npm
  authentication in this revision.
- The shared shell helper never uses `eval`; validated input only ever
  reaches Docker argv as array elements.
- A source configuration change invalidates the affected build layers and
  requires a Worker rebuild.

## fnOS integration and base-image pulls

- HomeRail does not choose or ship mirror vendors. Concrete fnOS mirror
  values are owned by the fnOS packaging issue #197 and are injected through
  the fnOS service environment at build time; this contract only defines the
  validated injection surface.
- Pulling the `node:22-slim` base image is not covered by these variables.
  It remains the responsibility of Docker daemon configuration (daemon
  proxy, registry mirrors, and DNS), not of the Worker build contract.
